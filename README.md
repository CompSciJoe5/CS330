Approaching Software Design
Designing software for this project involved breaking down a 2D image into fundamental 3D shapes while considering computational efficiency and rendering performance. The process began with analyzing the client’s requirements and planning how to translate them into a structured 3D environment using OpenGL. The project emphasized low-polygon modeling to balance visual fidelity and performance, ensuring that each object was composed of a minimal number of triangles while still accurately representing real-world structures. Spatial organization was also a key consideration, requiring precise placement of objects using X, Y, and Z coordinates to maintain proportional accuracy relative to the original image. Throughout the process, best practices such as modular coding, scene organization, and user interactivity were incorporated to create a well-structured 3D representation that could be navigated effectively.

This project helped develop critical design skills such as geometric decomposition, scene layout structuring, and interactive navigation planning. Understanding how to break down complex forms into simpler primitives strengthened my ability to visualize 3D space efficiently. Additionally, implementing camera controls and lighting required careful consideration of user experience, ensuring that the environment was easy to explore while maintaining a polished visual presentation. These tactics are applicable to future work in game development, virtual simulations, and software engineering, where designing interactive 3D environments requires a structured approach. The incremental design process used in this project mirrors real-world software engineering practices, where planning, iteration, and refinement play crucial roles in delivering a functional and visually appealing application.

Approaching Program Development
Developing the 3D scene required an incremental and structured approach, beginning with basic object creation and progressing to interactive elements and visual enhancements. Initially, I focused on constructing low-poly 3D models using OpenGL primitives, ensuring that the shapes were optimized for performance. As the project advanced, I applied transformations to position objects accurately, refining their orientation and spatial relationships to match the original 2D image. The integration of interactivity was a significant step in the development process, as I incorporated user input controls for camera movement, allowing navigation across all three axes using the WASD, QE keys, and mouse input. Adding these controls required careful adjustment of the camera’s orbit radius to ensure all objects were visible from multiple perspectives while maintaining a smooth user experience.

Throughout the project, iteration played a vital role in refining the scene and resolving development challenges. Debugging lighting and texture issues required frequent testing and adjustments, particularly in ensuring that the Phong shading model components—ambient, diffuse, and specular—were correctly applied to create realistic lighting effects. Additionally, optimizing the camera movement and interaction logic improved usability, making navigation more intuitive. My development strategies evolved from a procedural coding approach to a more modular structure, where reusable functions were implemented for object creation, transformations, and rendering. This shift improved code maintainability and efficiency, aligning with industry best practices in software development. The project reinforced my ability to manage complexity by structuring code logically, a skill that will be valuable in future software engineering and graphics programming tasks.

Future Applications of Computer Science
The skills gained from this project extend beyond 3D graphics, reinforcing broader computer science principles that will be beneficial in both academic and professional settings. Developing this scene strengthened my understanding of C++ and OpenGL, which are widely used in game development, simulations, and data visualization. Additionally, the project required an application of mathematical concepts such as transformations, vector calculations, and lighting models, deepening my ability to work with computational algorithms. These concepts are transferable to areas like machine learning, physics simulations, and software engineering, where mathematical modeling and data processing play a crucial role.

From a professional standpoint, the experience of designing and implementing a structured 3D environment aligns with careers in game development, computer-aided design (CAD), and virtual reality (VR) applications. The ability to optimize performance while maintaining visual quality is a critical skill in graphics-intensive fields, and the problem-solving strategies used in debugging this project will be useful in troubleshooting real-world software issues. Additionally, the interactive components of the scene highlight the importance of user experience (UX) in software design, a key consideration in web development, application design, and human-computer interaction. By applying computational graphics and visualization techniques, I have gained valuable problem-solving abilities and technical knowledge that will support my educational growth and prepare me for professional opportunities in software engineering and beyond.
